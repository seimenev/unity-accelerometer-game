# Accelerometer game for Unity3D
After deciding to move on from Unity3D and create my own engine, I have decided to release all the source code to my Unity3D projects as open source. All code is provided as is. As a solo developer, the code has little documentation and comments, but should be easy enough to follow.

No assets, Unity project files, etc. is included. This is pure code.

# Content description
This is the source code for an accelerometer based game using Unity3D. The project was created on Unity 5.x, but later upgraded to Unity 2018 without testing. As a result, it might or might not work.

Main features:
- Accelerometer controls
- A camera-movement based menu system
- Full game in single scene with masked transitions; no loading screens apart from the first one
- Some basic gameplay for a game where you collect items by tilting the phone
- Some basic remote leaderboard functionality
